# Unit 5 c3

 - Create an employee management system for a company's HR.
 - The Applications main goal is to create a dashboard that can manage, hire, fire or promote employees
 - use mock server to store and retrieve data, make sure that URL is `localhost:8080/employee` anything else will not work
 - visit the demo video given in the assignment for better clarity
 - The app has multiple routes
   - `/` Shows <Home> component, homepage
   
   - `/login` shows <Login> component
   - `/employees` shows <EmployeeList> for listing employees
   - `/employees/:id` shows details of one employee
   - `/admin` Shows one administrator panel to add employee <Admin> 
   - `/logout` for <Logout> for signing user out
 - The app has total 2 Private Routes, and they should not be visible unless user is logged in: Employee details and Admin page
 - Authentication status is mainted in memory via Context API
 - Navbar should show only 4 Links at a time:
   - Home
   - Employee list
   - Admin
   - Login if user is logged in, otherwise Logout
 - Home page shows a statistics dashboard which will show following information:
   - Total Employees in the database (get this from backend) `.totalemp`
   - Total Terminated (Read bellow) `.total_terminated`
   - Total Promoted (Read bellow) `.total_promoted`
   - Total New (Read bellow) `.total_new`
 - here `.` means it's a classname, ignore that if you are using given boilerplate
 - The Total Terminated, Promoted, and newly created count is in memory, maintain it in Another context API, increment it when termination, promotion happens or a new user gets created.
 - The next page is Employee list, it shows one card for every employee, by clicking anywhere on the card you get to go to that employees details
 - the entire component is a div with class `list_container`
 - every card in this component has class name `employee_card`
 - Every card shows following information:
   - Image of employee `.employee_image`
   - name of employee in `.employee_name`
   - Title of employee in `.employee_title`
 - Next page is employee details make sure it's a private page
 - If user tries to visit `/employees/:id` without loggin in he should get redirected to `/login` and see login component
 - if he's already logged in then he should see employee details as follows:
   - entire component has `.user_details`
   - user image: `.user_image`
   - user name `.user_name`
   - user salary: `.user_salary`
   - users current tasks list `.tasks` :
     - create one <li> with `.task`
   - user status: `.status`
   - user title: `.title`
   - Show a button `Fire Employee` on this card only if user is not already terminated `.fire`
   - show a button to `Promote` employee, with class `.promote` only if user is not already a `Team Lead` and not terminated
   - if user is fired, or promoted increment the stats in context
 - The employee status can either be `working` or `terminated`
 - Employees titles can only be in order: `Intern` `Jr Software Developer`, `Sr Software Developer`, `Team Lead`.
 - If you promote an `Intern` he becomes `Jr` then `Sr` then finally `Team Lead`. thus cannot promote Team Lead, so button will not be visible
 - As soon as you promote or fire employee, the status should be changed immediately on the same page
 - `Login` component is easy login form `.loginform`
 - input name=username `.login_username`
 - input name="password `.login_password`
 - input type="submit" `.login_submit`
 - on clicking submit, make request to `https://reqres.in/api/login` with proper username and password, get token back, change status in context.
 - after loggin in user should automatically taken to whichever page he was trying to visit
 - if user is logged in, then navbar will show logout button
 - Logout component is same, it doesn't show any UI
 - when user visits /logout, just change value of authentication in context API
 - after loggin out take user to `/` always
 - <Admin> page is just a form with following values
 - admin page if private
 - use the same `name` given below
   - form `.createEmployee`
   - Name: input name="employee_name
   - ID: input  name="employee_id"
   - select dropdown for Title name="title"
     - Values: `intern`,  `Jr Software Developer`, `Sr Software Developer` and `Team Lead`
   - Salary Input: name="salary"
   - user Image: name="image"
   - username for user name="username"
   - password name="password"
   - input name="tasks" for tasks he's working on, comma seperated strings: eg: `writting tests, working on dashboard`
   - select name="status" for Status of employee
     - terminated
     - working
   - select name="team" for which team user is part of
     - values: frontend, backend, qa (stands for quality analysis)
   - input `.createUser` for submitting form
   - user should fill ALL values before submitting
   - Once user is created, update the statistics in home dashboard
